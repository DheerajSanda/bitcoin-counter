This project is a simple ReactJS single page application (SPA), this project is created using create-react-app. It uses build tools like Babel and webpack under the hood, but works with zero configuration.

In this project firebase platform is used for authentication and backend. Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service â€” BaaS. We need to create a project in the firebase and we should provide the API keys to this project in the Config/Firebase/db_config.js file. 

Actually these keys should not be made public, but for now, I am providing it for this project.

To run the app, first we need to clone the repo into your computer and open the directory and run the command "npm install", this will install all the dependencies required for this project listed in package.json. Be sure you have already installed the nodejs and node package manager.

For a quick start you can run the command "npm run start" to run the project locally. If you want to create a build you can run the command "npm run build".
